# SteamFriends

This is a handler for Community functionality. Initialize it by passing a SteamClient instance to the constructor.

```js
var steamFriends = new Steam.SteamFriends(steamClient);
```

Chat-related methods automatically convert ClanIDs (group's SteamID) to ChatIDs. Conversely, ChatIDs are converted to ClanIDs in chat-related events if it's a group chat (i.e. not an "ad hoc" chat), otherwise left alone. In the following docs, chat SteamID always refers to ClanID for group chats and ChatID otherwise.

## Properties

### personaStates

Information about users you have encountered. It's an object whose keys are SteamIDs and values are [`CMsgClientPersonaState.Friend`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/master/Resources/Protobufs/steamclient/steammessages_clientserver.proto) objects.

### clanStates

Information about groups you have encountered. It's an object whose keys are SteamIDs and values are [`CMsgClientClanState`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/master/Resources/Protobufs/steamclient/steammessages_clientserver.proto) objects.

### chatRooms

Information about chat rooms you have joined. It's an object with the following structure:
```js
{
  "steamID of the chat": {
    "steamID of one of the chat's current members": {
      rank: "EClanPermission",
      permissions: "a bitset of values from EChatPermission"
    }
    // other members
  }
  // other chats
}
```

For example, `Object.keys(steamClient.chatRooms[chatID])` will return an array of the chat's current members, and `steamClient.chatRooms[chatID][memberID].permissions & Steam.EChatPermission.Kick` will evaluate to a nonzero value if the specified user is allowed to kick from the specified chat.

### friends

An object that maps users' SteamIDs to their `EFriendRelationship` with you. Empty until ['relationships'](#relationships) is emitted. ['friend'](#friend) is emitted before this object changes.

### groups

An object that maps groups' SteamIDs to their `EClanRelationship` with you. Empty until ['relationships'](#relationships) is emitted. ['group'](#group) is emitted before this object changes.

## Methods

### setPersonaName(name)

Changes your Steam profile name.

### setPersonaState(EPersonaState)

You'll want to call this with `EPersonaState.Online` upon logon, otherwise you'll show up as offline.

### sendMessage(steamID, message, [EChatEntryType])

Last parameter defaults to `EChatEntryType.ChatMsg`. Another type you might want to use is `EChatEntryType.Emote`.

### requestChatHistory(steamID)

Request your chat history and unread offline messages with another user. You'll get the results in the ['messageHistory' event](#messagehistory).

### addFriend(steamID)

Sends a friend request.

### removeFriend(steamID)

Removes a friend.

### joinChat(steamID)

Attempts to join the specified chat room. The result should arrive in the ['chatEnter' event](#chatenter).

### leaveChat(steamID)

Self-explanatory.

### chatInvite(chatSteamID, invitedSteamID)

Invites the specified user to the specified chat.

### getSteamLevel(steamids, callback)

Requests the Steam level of a number of specified accounts. The `steamids` argument should be an array of SteamIDs.

The single object parameter of the `callback` has the requested SteamIDs as properties and the level as their values. Example:

```js

	"76561197960287930": 7
}
```

The response, if any, should arrive in the ['personaState' event](#personastate).

### setIgnoreFriend(steamID, setIgnore, callback)

### 'relationships'
